## Rev. A Problem Log

* Silkscreens for 0805's need to be fixed
* Make all LEDs Low Active... 
** Why? because I don't have an option for the
   RGB LED and they should all be the same. 
* Problem with D3 connections pins 1 and 2 were swapped on footprint. 
** Fix footprint.
** Interim, rip up traces and reroute for writing firmware.
* Battery doesn't last long.  Likely because I haven't optimized for 
  low current draw yet... Try to fix this ASAP.
